** Introduction

*Dirvish* is a minimalistic file manager based on *dired-mode*.  It is inspired
by [[https://github.com/ranger/ranger][ranger]], which is a terminal file manager that shows a stack of the parent
directories, and updates its parent buffers while navigating the file system
with an optional preview window showing the selected file.

Unlike [[https://github.com/ralesi/ranger.el][ranger.el]], which tries to become an all-around emulation of ranger,
*dirvish* is more bare-bone, meaning it does *NOT* try to port all "goodness"
from ranger. Instead, it tries to:

  - provides a better dired UI
  - improve some dired commands, make them more intuitive and accesible.
  - keep all your dired key bindings

The name *dirvish* is a tribute to [[https://github.com/justinmk/vim-dirvish][vim-dirvish]].

** Installation

Dirvish is available from [[https://melpa.org][Melpa]], you can install it directly via =package-install=
