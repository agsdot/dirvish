#+begin_quote
A minimalistic yet versatile file manager based on *Dired*.
#+end_quote

** Introduction

This package empowers Dired with:

- Different layouts support
- Isolated sessions
- A modern and modular user interface
- A few (optional) useful extensions

Let Dirvish become your Dired, [[https://github.com/ranger/ranger][ranger]], even [[https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs][treemacs]].

** Installation

Dirvish is available on [[https://melpa.org][Melpa]].

*** For =package.el= users

You can install it directly via ~package-install~ if you have melpa in your ~package-archives~.

*** For =straight.el= users

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package 'dirvish)
#+end_src

*** Manual install

To install it manually, first clone this repository, then add =path/to/dirvish= to your ~load-path~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/dirvish")
;; If you want the extensions as well
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/dirvish/extensions")
(require 'dirvish)
#+end_src

** Quickstart
*** Dirvish sessions

You can start a Dirvish session by =M-x= ~dirvish~ or ~dirvish-dired~.

- ~dirvish-dired~ creates a session in current window (like ~dired~).
- ~dirvish~ creates a session that makes use of the whole frame (see Figure 1).

Although based on Dired, Dirvish doesn't change any of your Dired config nor
rebind any keys in ~dired-mode-map~. As a result, a Dired user already knew how to
use Dirvish. (see also: [[#FAQ][How is Dirvish related to Dired?]])

It is also recommended to enable ~dirvish-override-dired-mode~, which makes all
your Dired entry commands including ~dired[-other-window/tab/frame]~ initialize or
reuse a Dirvish session automatically.

*** Additional Commands

| Command                        | Description                                 |
|--------------------------------+---------------------------------------------|
| ~dirvish-toggle-fullscreen~      | Enter or exit fullscreen state of a session |
| ~dirvish-show-history~           | Navigate to recently visited directories    |
| ~dirvish-other-buffer~           | Switch to most recent Dirvish buffer        |
| ~dirvish-browse-all-directories~ | Browse all directories using ~fd~ command     |

*NOTE*: This doesn't include commands in extensions, see [[file:Configuration.org][Configuration.org]].

** Extensions

Several small extension packages to Dirvish are maintained in the subdirectory
extensions/. These extensions are installed together with Dirvish if you pull
the package from MELPA. They are inactive by default and can be enabled manually
if desired. Currently the following extensions come with the Dirvish MELPA
package:

- [[file:extensions/dirvish-side.el][dirvish-side.el]]: Toggle Dirvish in side window like [[https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs][treemacs]].
- [[file:extensions/dirvish-yank.el][dirvish-yank.el]]: Multi-stage copy/pasting of files.
- [[file:extensions/dirvish-menu.el][dirvish-menu.el]]: Keybindings help menu powered by =transient.el=.
- [[file:extensions/dirvish-peek.el][dirvish-peek.el]]: File preview in minibuffer.
- [[file:extensions/dirvish-vc.el][dirvish-vc.el]]: Version-control (git) integration for Dirvish.
- [[file:extensions/dirvish-icons.el][dirvish-icons.el]]: Icon support for Dirvish.

With these extensions it is possible to adapt Dirvish such that it matches your
preference or behaves similar to other familiar file explorers.

** Customization

See [[file:Configuration.org][Configuration.org]] (included docs for extensions).

** Issues

- Bugs are expected on Windows since dirvish has not been tested on it.
- *WIP*: compatibility issues with some third-party dired related packages.

Feel free to report issues.

** FAQ
*** How is Dirvish related to Dired?

A Dirvish session holds a set of buffers with ~dirvish-mode~ as its ~major-mode~. As
discussed above, since ~dirvish-mode~ is a derived mode from ~dired-mode~, most of
the Dired commands work exactly the same in a ~dirvish-mode~ buffer.

Nonetheless, Dirvish and Dired handle these aspects differently:

+ Buffer management ::

  Navigating through the file system using Dired always end up with a lot of
  Dired buffers. You can either replace ~dired-find-file~ with
  ~dired-find-alternate-file~ or enable ~dired-kill-when-opening-new-dired-buffer~
  which inhibit new buffer generation in some cases, whereas the drawbacks are:

  - It does NOT work for all navigation commands such as ~dired-up-directory~
  - Kill an old buffer also removes all the metadata (such as marks) it holds
  - Performance issue on slow disk (think of revisiting a huge directory)

  Dirvish does not kill the old Dirvish buffer when entering a new Dirvish
  buffer, instead it kill all buffers that this session holds when exits.

+ Mode line ::

  Dirvish has its own mode-line that can be customized with
  ~dirvish-mode-line-format~, hence the ~dired-switches-in-mode-line~ option doesn't
  work in Dirvish.
