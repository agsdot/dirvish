- a (CMD . ARGS) cons where CMD can be a elisp function or a

for them.

- a string which is displayed directly in preview buffer.  Need
  to use in conjunction with `info' PREVIEW-TYPE.

A PREVIEW-TYPE can be one of following values:

- `info', which means insert PAYLOAD string to preview buffer.

- `buffer', meaning either PAYLOAD itself is a buffer
  or `(apply CMD ARGS)' return a buffer directly as preview
  buffer.

- `image', meaning `(apply CMD ARGS)' should return a image to be
  inserted to preview buffer.

- `shell', indicates CMD is a shell command, the result of CMD
  and ARGS will be inserted in preview buffer as content when the
  shell process exits successfully.
