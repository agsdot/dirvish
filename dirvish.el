;;; Commentary:

;; `dirvish' is a minimalistic file manager based on `dired-mode'.  It is
;; inspired by ranger (see https://github.com/ranger/ranger), which is a
;; terminal file manager that shows a stack of the parent directories, and
;; updates its parent buffers while navigating the file system with an optional
;; preview window at side showing the content of the selected file.

;; Unlike `ranger.el', which tries to become an all-around emulation of ranger,
;; dirvish.el is more bare-bone, meaning it does NOT try to port all "goodness"
;; from ranger, instead, it tries to:
;;
;;   - provides a better Dired UI
;;   - make some Dired commands more intuitive
;;   - keep all your Dired key bindings
;;
;; The name `dirvish' is a tribute to `vim-dirvish'.
